  AIPTV is an M3U proxy server, developed through AI-assisted programming.

  This project began as an experiment to see what I can create with AI and limited programming experience. 
  It has since expanded to include a modern approach to playlist management, 
  combining proxy capabilities with an intuitive user interface.
